# eecs280
This repository is not associated with official enrollment or attendance at the University of Michigan.
It contains all of my self learning materials for EECS280 Fall 2021 from the University of Michigan.
This course has served as a foundation in my understanding of computer science concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
Furthermore, I was able to really dive into the features in the C++ language by learning to use operator overloading, templates, iterators, "The Big Three", and more. This is a remarkably well put together course, and I want to thank Professor James Juett for his easy to follow lectures on these topics!
